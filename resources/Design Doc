ITP 368 Design Documentation

The game is a role-playing game where the player explores an overworld from a top-down perspective. The player will encounter random enemies in instanced battles. Battles happen in real-time, and the player will have to use abilities bound to number keys in order to defeat enemies. These abilities will all be based on cooldown timers.

Class: GameApplication
The main application will have several private pane variables that represent game states, including a title screen, the world map, battle instance, and a game over screen.
Instances of player classes and animations will be created here.
Key events for actions and movements will be handled here.

Class: Entity
Most classes will inherit from this class. This class should contain key information to be implemented such as names, images, a SpriteAnimation, StatusBars.

Class: Frog  Entity
This is the player controlled entity in the game. This should have a health, power, experience, level stat. It also should contain an array of abilities that the player will accrue throughout levelling up. Frog should have an image view that is created from the image of the entity. Like entity, it should have a SpriteAnimation that takes its image view.

Class: SpriteAnimation
This class is used to animate players in the game. Each entity will have to have this as a private, instance variable. This takes in an ImageView that should be present in the class that it belongs to.

Class: StatusBar
This is used to visualize the player’s health, experience, and power resource. This is the base class which other classes will inherit from. It has methods to animate based on the deduction or addition of points.

Class: HealthBar  StatusBar
This inherits from StatusBar, which visualizes players’ health. The color of the bar will be set to red. They will have variables that are depended on the specific entities’ health variable.

Class: PowerBar  StatusBar
This inherits from StatusBar, which visualizes players’ power resource. The color of the bar will be set to blue. They will have variables that are depended on the specific entities’ power variable.

Class: ExpBar  StatusBar
This inherits from StatusBar, which visualizes players’ experience to the next level. The color of the bar will be set to yellow. They will have variables that are depended on the specific entities’ current level.

Class: Ability
Abilities are represented on screen as icons. They will use key events (number keys) to activate. They should all have cooldown times. Each will have a different effect that should be determined in their sub classes.
